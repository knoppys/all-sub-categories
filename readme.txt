Displays a list of all child categories and their associated post titles as links in a list format of a single user defined Parent Category.

== Description ==

I have plans to update this plugin and add another one similar for displaying Page Links in hierarchical order at any level of the tree.

The idea for this pliugin came from a need to use a single widget in UberMenu Item Widget areas to display a list of all sub categories and their post titles as links in a menu. We needed the widget to be totally dynamic and responsive. 

The widget I created gives the wordpress admin the option to select a single parent category from the "wp_dropdown_categories" select box in the widget admin area and the result is an unordered list of Child Category Titles and Linked Post Titles.

The great thing is theres no scripts and no complicated code. Its pure php and simple html. 

This plugin really shined when we used it with UberMenu.As no other plugin could be found that generated a straight forward never ending list, this now gave us a responsive and dynamic solution.
